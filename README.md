# release-tool

A release tool for generating detailed release notes

The `release-tool` utility is maintained as a separate repository
to reduce duplication across the various release branches of the main
`containerd/containerd` repository where it is used to cut release
notes and project data to aid release engineers.

The release tool is designed to be project agnostic and useful for
any project.
